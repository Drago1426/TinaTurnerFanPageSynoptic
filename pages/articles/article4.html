        <h2>Tina Turner Is Having the Time of Her Life</h2>
        <img src="/images/article4Image.jpg" alt="">

        <article>
            <div class="container">
                <p>Turner is 79 years old. She has been retired for 10 years, and she is still basking in all of the nothing she has to do. “I don’t sing. I don’t dance. I don’t dress up,” she told me. Even her wig — “a critical part of the Tina Turner look,” as she wrote in her recent memoir — has relaxed from its formerly perpendicular posture into a saucy shag. Her voice is as beguiling as ever, though it is now employed for different means. She slips into a rich continental accent when she calls for her husband, and she dives into her low, trembling rasp — “not the voice of a woman,” as she has put it — when she teases him.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In the film the hitmaker reveals how she wanted to enter the third and final chapter of her life out of
                    the spotlight, something which she has largely achieved during this last year. Speaking about her
                    difficult past, including the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that she developed as a result of
                    the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her first husband and music partner, Ike Turner, the
                    star admits that she has had an “abusive life” but remains “proud” at her achievements.</p>
                <br>
                <p>She does not miss performing. Oh, no. Even in 2009, as she romped around the world on the final dates of the “Tina! 50th Anniversary” tour, she was fantasizing, to be honest, about redecorating her house. She lived that life with Ike, and then she conquered that life with a life of her own, and now it was time to take in her unobstructed view of Lake Zurich. “I was just tired of singing and making everybody happy,” she said. “That’s all I’d ever done in my life.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once in a while, though, she will be in the car. The radio will come on, and with Bach humming respectfully beside her, she will give the song the full Tina Turner treatment, bouncing in her seat and purring for an audience of one. There is a song that she can’t resist. “Oh, what’s his name?” she called to her husband, who was puttering around in the next room. “Darling? What’s his name?” And then she did sing: “I want something just liiiike this!”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tina Turner has become a symbol of so many things — sex appeal, resilience, empowerment — that she cannot quite relate to. She was never trying to be sexy onstage; she was sweating through her clothes to sell her songs. And the idea of connecting her life to the feminist movement or recasting it through #MeToo feels alien to her. “I identify only with my life,” she said. While everyone was making her into a symbol, “I was busy doing it. Doing the work.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>The strength of her voice, and the power of her story, have seemed to build an almost invincible persona, but it’s just a persona. “I don’t necessarily want to be a ‘strong’ person,” she said. “I had a terrible life. I just kept going. You just keep going, and you hope that something will come.” She gestured around her. “This came.”</p>
