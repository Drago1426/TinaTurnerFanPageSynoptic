        <h2>Tina Turner: 'My medical adventure is far from over'
            - star's turbulent health history</h2>
        <img src="/images/article3Image.jpg" alt="">

        <article>
            <div class="container">
                <p>IT HAS been just over a year since the Tina Turner documentary, simply titled Tina, was released by HBO.
                    During the film 82-year-old Turner bid farewell to her fans whilst also looking back on the highs and
                    lows of her incredible career that has been plagued by numerous health conditions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In the film the hitmaker reveals how she wanted to enter the third and final chapter of her life out of
                    the spotlight, something which she has largely achieved during this last year. Speaking about her
                    difficult past, including the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that she developed as a result of
                    the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her first husband and music partner, Ike Turner, the
                    star admits that she has had an “abusive life” but remains “proud” at her achievements.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition to crippling mental health conditions, Turner has battled stroke, cancer and kidney failure
                    which led to a transplant back in 2017 making her career even more remarkable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Confessing herself that she has been through some “very serious sicknesses," Turner’s health first took a
                    worrying turn in 2013 after she suffered from a stroke.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Stroke</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Just three weeks after the wedding of her second husband Erwin Bach, the star was left needing to learn
                    how to walk again after suffering from the life-threatening condition that occurs when the blood supply
                    to part of the brain is cut off.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Recalling the ordeal in an interview with Oprah Winfrey back in 2018, Turner explained that she was
                    suffering from chest pains - a possible symptom of stroke and heart attack - on the day of her wedding
                    but was fortunately able to complete the ceremony.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For some people, a stroke can cause some serious long-term problems due to the injury to their brain. Due
                    to this a period of rehabilitation is needed in order to help them recover their former independence.
                    However, many never fully recover and need ongoing support after their stroke.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Luckily Turner was able to learn how to walk again but only three years later the star was diagnosed with
                    both intestinal cancer and kidney failure.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Intestinal Cancer</h3>
                <br>
                <p>“I know that my medical adventure is far from over,” Turner wrote in her 2018 memoir Tina Turner: My Love
                    Story before going on to explain her battle with cancer, which she said caused “no pain” in her body.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Intestinal cancer, also called small intestine cancer or small bowel cancer, usually starts in the lining
                    of the small intestine with the potential to spread from the digestive system to other parts of the
                    body.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, cancer affects everyone differently and for some, like Turner, symptoms might not make
                    themselves apparent. Speaking back in 2018 the singer said: “I had no pain but my body was reacting from
                    cancer in the colon, from the kidney failure.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Kidney Failure</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Research in the past has concluded that the risk of developing colorectal cancer was increased in those
                    with chronic kidney diseases, especially those who have not had a kidney transplant.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys don't work as well as they
                    should. Although it is more common in older people, it can be caused by conditions that put a strain in
                    the kidneys or block urine flow, which colorectal cancer has the potential to do.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once diagnosed there is no cure for CKD, however a kidney transplant may be necessary for individuals who
                    have an advanced version of the disease. In Turner’s case, her second husband Bach was the one who
                    offered to donate a kidney for transplant, and the procedure took place in 2017.</p>
