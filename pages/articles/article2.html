                <p>Tina Turner has paid tribute to her “beloved son” Ronnie Turner, who has died at the age of 62.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In an online post the singer, 83, said her son had “left the world far too early”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ronnie Turner died on Thursday 8 December, after reportedly suffering from past health issues.</p>
                <br>
                <p>He enjoyed a career as a musician, playing with the group Manufactured Funk, and also took a role in
                    the
                    1993 film What’s Love Got to Do With It, a biopic about his mother.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On Friday Tina Turner posted a black and white photo to Instagram in tribute to her son.</p>
                <br>
                <p>“Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved
                    son,”
                    the singer captioned the photo.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ronnie Turner was the singer’s son with ex-husband Ike Turner.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Her eldest son Craig Turner, whom she had with musician Raymond Hill, died by suicide in 2018.</p>
